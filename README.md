# JPLogic Rail Operating Centre
## Currently Work In Progress!

____
JPLogics ROC is the new, leading way to automate your Minecraft Railway system.
Using a combination of the following;
- ComputerCraft
- TrainCraft
- RailCraft
- Immibis RFID

The system, can run all your trains automatically to a user created timetable.
Want a regular passenger service from your Spawn City to some villages? No problem.
Want a freight service from your quarry to take your goods to your factory? No problem.

The system can even be linked to other devices to note when trains are full, then wait for the train next schedualed "Slot".
Stations are completely controlled too, no more making the cart stop for X amount of seconds then  firing it off somewhere, if you wanted a train to sit in the platform for 6 hours...IT CAN! The times are completely up to you.

I can be contacted on Discord: @JPLogics#2532 if you have suggestions or questions.
